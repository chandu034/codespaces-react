      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Chandra Sekhar, a frontend developer with 3.5+ years of experience building highly interactive,
        scalable web apps. I specialize in React and Next.js, blending performance with sleek UI/UX.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently shaping UI magic at <strong>Ivoyant</strong>, I also served as a <strong>Graduate Teaching Assistant</strong> at
        Kennesaw State University, where I helped students understand software concepts and programming foundations.
      </p>
      <p>
        My stack includes <strong>React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase, GitHub, Ant Design</strong>
        and more. I enjoy building beautiful interfaces that are both functional and performant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Off duty? I explore AI/ML side quests, build planner apps, and experiment with glitch animations or cringe
        video scripts for fun.
      </p>
